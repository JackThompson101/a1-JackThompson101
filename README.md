# CS 4241 - Webware

Jack Thompson: https://sixth-foil-marten.glitch.me/index.html

This project shows a little bit about me and talks about my academic career. I also talk about one of my favorite hobbies which is football. Wether it is watching coaching or playing, I have always spent much of my free time involved in the sport.

## Technical Achievements

### CSS Styling

- **Google Fonts**: Uses the `Bebas Neue` font which is basic but gives a clean look
- **Body Styling**: Provides a consistent layout. It also has backup fonts if a browser doesn't support `Bebas Neue`.
- **Navigation Bar**:

  - Made it so that the navbar is clean and matches the minimalist style of the rest of the page.
  - On hover, it will display my accent color -- red 
- **Headers and Text**:

  - `h1` styling
    - Align the text center
    - Add some margain at the bottom
  - `h3` styling
    - Add color to match style
    - Add margain for readablity
  - `p` styling
    - Margain for better readability.
- **Lists**:

  - Styled `ul` and `li` for better spaced list items.
- **Links**:
  - Custom styles for `a` tags with hover transitions.
    - On Hover turn red
  
- **Tables**:
  - Fully styled tables
  - Alternating row colors for readability
    - This was new to me to use the `nth-child()` rule.
  - Box-shadow for general style
- **Profile and Picture Classes**:
  - I styled the profile and picture class so that I have a circle profile picture and my name next to it.
  - I did this using flex row to make them go side by side and align-items center to vertically align

- **Footer**:
  - I styled this the same way as the header so it would match.

### Javascript Animation

I wrote the file `animation.js`. This file looks for any `h1` in the html which in this case is my name, and then it gives it a small glitch effect.

### Semantic Tags

I added a `footer` tag so that I could add a copy right

I added 3 `section` to better divide the index page

I added an `image` as a profile picture

I added `header` tags to the navbar just for code readability

I added `main` and `section` tags to the hobby page for code readability

### Design Achievements

### Adobe Color Palette

The Color Palette is included in this folder under `a1-colorpalette.jpg`. I wanted to go for a minimalist style.

### Google Font Integration

I used `Bebas Neue` as the font for the primary text for my site. A little different, but I like the bold and all caps look it gives to my site
